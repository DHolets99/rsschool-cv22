### Code example
Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.
Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

```
function digital_root(n) {
  return n <=9 ? n : digital_root(n.toString().split('').reduce( (a,b) => +a + +b));
}
```
